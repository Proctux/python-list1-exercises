# python-list1-exercises
This is the first list of exercises done in Python. It was done for the Introduction to Structured Programming class

#The results
Below, I'm going to show the outputs results for each exercise of the list.

# Exercise number 01

The first exercise requested to calculate the sum between 2 integers: a = 30 and b = 40. The result was:

# Exercise number 02

This exercise requested the multiplication between 3 integers: a= 30, b = 40 and c = 50.

# Exercise number 03

This exercise provided 2 integers: a = 40 and b = 40 and requested the division between these two integers.

# Exercise number 04

Given 2 integers, a = 50 and b = 25, we should return the decrease between them.

# Exercise number 05

This another exercise, requested us to make a program which would wait an input (string) after make the question: What is your name? <br/>
After that, the program would be requested to show the input name and ask the user another question: How are you, *User*?

# Exercise number 06

The exercise number 06 requested to codification of a program and analysis it's results. First, we requested the users 2 numbers as inputs (a_str and b_str).
Secondly, we converted these two inputs from strings to integers (a_int and b_int). Thirdly, we did the sum between these values (a_int and b_int). Finally
We showed the results on the screen as the following sentence: *A soma de **a_int** + **b_int** Ã© igual a: **soma** *

# Exercise number 07

Here, we should convert a given string into an integer using the function int().

# Exercise number 08

Now, in exercise number 08 were given 2 integers, a = 3 and b = 2. After that, we should build a program which could divide the given values and return an integer istead of a float.

# Exercise number 09

In exercise number 09, we should make another program capacible to round the given number *5.9874* for just two numbers after the point.

# Exercise number 10

Finally, in the last exercise, were given a lot of values, which we should only check the Formatting operators in Python.

- [x] %d is used for decimals and integers; <br/>
- [x] %x is used to check the Hexecimal of a number; <br/>
- [x] %f is used as Default value; <br/>
- [x] %e is used to represents an exponentiation of a huge number; <br/>
- [x] %d with a number between % and d (%10d) will justify to the right a number of **n** times of given number; <br/>
- [x] %d with a hyphen (or minus) + number between % and d (%-10d) will justify to the left a number of **n** times of given number; <br/>
- [x] %d with a point + number between % and d (%.9d) will format the number, adding or removing **n** numbers to the given number; <br/>
- [x] %f with a point + number between % and f (%.3f) will format the float number, adding or removing **n** numbers to the given float number after the point; <br/>
- [x] %s is a formatting operator for strings. If we place a point + a number between % and s (%.10s), it will format the string to the maximum of **n** caracters.
